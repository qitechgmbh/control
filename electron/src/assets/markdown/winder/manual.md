# 1.4 Intended use

The QiTech Winder is designed for winding and rewinding filaments between 1 mm and 3 mm.
The winder must be placed on a stable, level surface and secured if necessary. The test and work sequence is described in chapter 3.4 Work sequence.
When using the winder, it is essential that the work steps described in the chapter "Work sequence" or in the operating instructions are followed.
In the event of significant changes or deviations, it is necessary to carry out a new risk assessment in accordance with the Machinery Directive and to document the changes in the corresponding documents.

<br>

The machine is designed exclusively for use inside buildings. The machine must not be operated in potentially explosive atmospheres. Use in the area of food production is prohibited.
Use of the machine for purposes other than those specified is prohibited.
Other intended uses include cleaning and maintenance work as well as troubleshooting, fault rectification and repair.

<br><br>

# 1.5 Reasonably foreseeable misuse

Reasonably foreseeable misuse exists in particular when winding unsuitable filaments:

- Filaments that are difficult to bend
- Easily tearable filaments
- Filaments outside the permitted diameter range of 1mm - 3mm
- Filaments with a surface temperature of > 50°C
- Particularly flat, sharp-edged or pointed filaments

In addition, the following procedures must be regarded as misuse:

- Operating the winder on an uneven surface or in a position other than the intended horizontal position or on an unbraked trolley.
- The use of unauthorized coil sizes.
- Use of spare parts and components not authorized by the manufacturer.
- Operating the winder without supervision or in ghost shifts.

<br><br><br>

![spool sizes](src/assets/markdown/winder/spools.jpeg)

<br><br><br>

Furthermore, there is always the possibility that existing/provided safety guards are dismantled or the existing sensors are manipulated or triggered by means other than the intended components.

The misuse mentioned must be explicitly prohibited with reference to these operating instructions and by written operating instructions, and the use of the winder must also be explicitly restricted in the operating instructions to the intended use mentioned above.

Maintenance and repair of the machine may only be carried out by the manufacturer's employees, trained skilled workers or semi-skilled and trained personnel.

<br>

# 1.6 Significant modification / other use

Any use of the machine other than the intended use is prohibited and is considered improper use. Claims of any kind against the manufacturer or its authorized representatives due to damage resulting from improper use of the machine are excluded. The operator alone is liable for all damage caused by improper use.

<br>

# 1.7 Description of the safety devices

**Emergency stop devices**

The emergency stop switch is used to quickly stop the machine in the event of danger. It can be reached from all positions in front of the machine. When an emergency stop device is actuated, the entire machine is stopped by disconnecting the mains supply.

Hazardous movements are brought to a controlled standstill as quickly as possible. The machine can only be restarted by physically resetting the emergency stop switch and then starting one of the operating modes in the software.

<br>

<img src="src/assets/markdown/winder/emergency_stop.jpeg" width="300" height="300"/>

<br>

**Overheating protection**

If one of the motor drivers becomes too hot, it switches off automatically and sends an error message to the control system. This then stops all other components of the machine.

<br>

**Spool stop in the event of filament breakage**

If the filament tears during winding, the spool stops automatically after a short time.

<br>

**Separating protective devices:**

The housing clad with aluminum-dibond plates prevents contact with hot motors, interference with the drive spindle of the traverse and manipulation of the electronics. It also prevents electrostatic charges from jumping from the filament to the electronics.

If guards are opened or removed for maintenance work, they must be closed or refitted before the machine is switched on again. It is not permitted to operate the machine without all properly installed and operational protective devices.

<br><br>

# 1.8 Instruction and Training

As the contractor/operator, you are obliged to inform and instruct the operating personnel about existing legal and accident prevention regulations as well as about existing safety equipment on the winder. This obligation also extends to safety equipment installed around the winder. The various technical qualifications of the employees must be taken into account.

The operating personnel must have understood the instruction and it must be ensured that the instruction is observed. This is the only way to ensure that your personnel work in a safety and hazard-conscious manner. Compliance with the contents of the instruction should be checked regularly.

As the owner/operator, you must therefore obtain written confirmation from each employee that they have attended an instruction session.

<br><br>

# 1.9 Noise emissions from the machine during activities

The noise emissions of the machine were measured on the same machine types. Under normal operating conditions, the maximum noise emission of the extruder is below the maximum permitted values.

Depending on the activity or the duration of the activity, the operator must determine whether suitable hearing protection is required as part of a risk assessment.

<br><br><br>

# 2 Life phases of the machine

<br>

# 2.1 Transport and Assembly

**Requirements for the installation site**

- Installation only in industrial and commercial indoor areas.
- The surface must be level and solid.
- The location must be as fire-free as possible and equipped with a fire extinguisher.

<br><br>

<br>

![screenshot of update tab](src/assets/markdown/winder/screenshot_updates.png)

<br>

**Safety Measures**

Some important safety measures must be observed to ensure safe operation of the QiTech Winder:

- It is important to only use original fuses with the prescribed current ratings to avoid overloading.
- If inspection, maintenance and repair work is carried out on electrical components, these must be de-energized beforehand. Equipment that has been disconnected must be secured against unintentional or automatic reconnection. First check that there is no voltage and insulate neighboring live components.
- Care must be taken to ensure that design features are not modified in such a way as to reduce safety.
- If it is necessary to work on live components, an additional person should be called in to operate the emergency stop button or the main switch in an emergency.
- Only voltage-insulated tools and appropriate clothing may be used.
- Proper earthing of the electrical system must be ensured by protective conductor systems.
- Cables must be checked regularly for damage and replaced if necessary.

<br>

# 2.3 Operation and control (work sequence)

A visual inspection must be carried out every working day before the machine is started.

Then start the machine as follows:

**1. Switch on the machine by plugging in the 220V power supply**

<br><br>

## 2.4 Maintenance, inspection, Testing

Maintenance and servicing work on the machine may only be carried out by reliable, trained personnel. The minimum age required by law in the country of use must be observed!

Personnel to be trained, instructed or undergoing general training may only work on the Winder under the constant supervision of an experienced person!

<br>

**Updating the Winder software**

There are regular updates for the "QiTech Control" software, which may contain bug fixes as well as new functions or security updates. It is therefore recommended that you regularly check if new Updates are available and install them as described in section 2.2.

<br>

**Lubricating the traverse spindle**

The threaded spindle must be re-oiled after approx. 20 operating hours, but at the latest when the traverser no longer moves to the desired position because the motor is spinning.

To do this, loosen the plate on the top of the housing with an M5 Allen key and drizzle commercially available lubricating oil or grease, e.g. WD40, over the entire length of the threaded spindle.

<br>

**Retightening screw connections**

After approx. 100 operating hours, the rear panel of the winder should be removed using an M5 Allen key so that the screw connections inside the housing can be retightened. The following should be checked:

- Grub screws of the motor couplings (puller, traverse, coil)
- Fastening screws of the motors (puller, traverse, coil)
- Fastening screws of the angle sensor of the load arm

All should be tightened at least hand-tight.

<br>

**Replacing the puller rollers**

The polyurethane coating of the puller rollers will inevitably wear out over time. As soon as you notice the filament slipping through the rollers, they should be replaced. Suitable spare parts are available from the dealer. To replace them, unfasten the screws marked red in the picture.

Now remove the black plastic caps and simply pull out the puller rollers. To install the new rollers back on, slide them on the axes, put the plastic cap back on and screw the screws.

<br>
<br>

## 2.5 Troubleshooting and fault rectification

<br>

**Machine is not recognized by QiTech Control**

- Is the LAN-cable connected?
- Is the latest version of QiTech Control installed?

<br>

**Filament tears off frequently**

- Was the filament sufficiently cooled before winding?
- Is the filament within the permitted diameter range of 1mm - 3mm?

<br>

**Puller rollers are scored**

It is normal for the puller rollers to wear out over time. However, some options can be checked:

- Is the surface temperature &#x3C; 50°C when the filament runs through the rollers?
- Is the filament slipping through the rollers instead of being conveyed by them, causing more abrasion?
- Is the tension of the filament too strong?

<br>

**Filament is not wound perfectly parallel**

- How large is the inner diameter of the spool on which the filament is wound? The closer the winding is to the traverse, the better the winding pattern will be.
- Have the spool sides been calibrated as described?
- Has the correct filament diameter been set?
- Have you tried to fine-tune the two settings independently of the procedure described here?
- Does the problem already occur in the first layer, or only afterwards? If the first layer is not perfectly wound (e.g. due to skewed threading), the filament in the subsequent layers always slips into the gaps in the winding below and "perfect winding" can no longer take place.

<br>

**Winder suddenly switches off**

One of the motor drivers has probably overheated. To prevent uncontrolled winding behavior, the controller therefore switches off the entire winder. It is advisable to wait approx. 5 minutes and try winding again. If the error occurs frequently, a lower ambient temperature (optionally housing temperature) must be ensured.

<br>

**Load adjustment does not work correctly at high or low speeds**

The sensor inside the housing has probably twisted and the load adjustment range has therefore shifted upwards or downwards. To rectify this, turn the angle sensor back and tighten its screws as described in "Tightening screw connections".

<br><br>

# 2.6 Disassembly, decommissioning and Disposal

When the machine has reached the end of its planned service life, it is recommended that the manufacturer be contacted for the purpose of taking it back free of charge. If this is not possible, the machine must be taken out of service permanently and then disposed of or scrapped properly.

To do this, first disconnect the entire power supply. All components must then be separated by material class to enable subsequent recycling or differentiated scrapping.

The machine consists largely of aluminum and plastic and can be easily separated by loosening the screw connections. Electrical scrap, plastic, rubber seals, lubricants and other auxiliary materials must be disposed of separately by an authorized specialist company.

| Picture                                                                        | Disposal Instructions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
