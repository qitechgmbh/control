<br>

## 1.5 Reasonably foreseeable misuse

Reasonably foreseeable misuse exists in particular due to the filling of unsuitable melting material.

The following procedures should also be regarded as misuse:

- Operating the extruder on an uneven surface or in a position other than the intended horizontal position or on an unbraked trolley.
- The introduction of unauthorized molten material (e.g. highly flammable or explosive substances, non-meltable substances).
- Tampering with hot machine parts or the hopper.
- Use of spare parts and components not authorized by the manufacturer.
- Operating the extruder without supervision by tired/stressed supervisors or in ghost shifts.

- Starting extrusion before the plastic has reached the required operating temperature.

- Dismantling machine parts that are surrounded by hardened plastic, in particular the melting head, screw and pressure sensor.

- Operating the heating elements without thermal mass (screw barrel) leads to them burning out.

Furthermore, there is always the possibility that existing/provided safety guards are dismantled or the existing sensors are manipulated or software restrictions are circumvented/deactivated.

The aforementioned misuse must be explicitly prohibited with reference to these operating instructions and by written operating instructions; the use of the extruder must also be explicitly restricted in the operating instructions to the aforementioned intended use.

This documentation refers exclusively to the operation of the extruder as documented in chapters 2.1 and 2.2. If the system is relocated or changes are made to the assemblies/configuration, the risk assessment must be repeated for the affected system parts or, in the case of significant changes within the meaning of the Product Safety Act, for the respective machine.

The maintenance and repair of the machine may only be carried out by the manufacturer's employees, trained skilled workers or semi-skilled and trained personnel.

In principle, it is possible to replace the die and melting head of the extruder with identical parts. This does not constitute a major modification / significant change within the meaning of the EC Machinery Directive or the Product Safety Act.

<br>
<br>

## 1.6 Substantial modification / other use

Any use of the machine other than the intended use is prohibited and is considered improper use. Claims of any kind against the manufacturer or its authorized representatives due to damage resulting from improper use of the machine are excluded. The operator alone is liable for all damage caused by improper use.

<br>
<br>

## 1.7 Description of the safety devices

ON/OFF switch or main switch

The machine has a main switch that disconnects/connects the mains supply. The ON/OFF switch can also be secured with a lock in the OFF position to prevent unauthorized persons from switching it on.

<br>

**Emergency stop devices**

The emergency stop switch is used to quickly stop the machine in the event of danger. This is designed with redundant emergency stop contactors. An emergency stop switching device also prevents the machine from being switched on again after a power failure. By activating the emergency stop device, the entire machine is shut down and disconnected from the mains supply.

![emergency stop button / switch](images/manuals/extruder/emergency_stop.jpeg)

Hazardous movements are brought to a controlled standstill as quickly as possible. The machine can only be restarted by physically resetting the emergency stop switch and then starting one of the operating modes in the software.

For more information, see chapter "Operation and control (work sequence)".

<br>

**Overload protection**

The inverter of the main motor is equipped with overload protection. This overload protection automatically switches off the main drive motor in the event of excessive power consumption or excessive temperature. This is made possible by the use of PTC thermistors/PTC resistors in the motor coils. The motor can only be switched on again after the machine has been restarted.

<br>

**Overheating protection**

The machine is equipped with overheating protection. This switches off the heating elements immediately in the event of impermissibly high operating temperatures. A warning is issued in the event of sensor errors. In addition, the selection by the operator is limited to the permissible temperature range by the software.

<br>

**Overpressure protection**

The machine is equipped with overpressure protection. This switches off the main drive motor immediately in the event of unexpectedly high pressure.

Under temperature protection

The software only allows the main motor to be switched on at a temperature of 100°C or higher. This minimizes the risk of screw breakage or motor failure due to start-up against excessive resistance.

<br>

**Isolating protective devices:**

- A lockable switch cabinet prevents interference with or tampering with the electrical system.
- The feed hopper is designed to prevent limbs from being drawn in by the rotating auger.
- The center section of the optional table structure prevents people from standing directly in front of the melting head.

If guards are opened or removed for the purpose of maintenance work, they must be closed or refitted before the machine is switched on again. It is not permitted to operate the machine without all properly installed and operational guards.

DANGER!

Danger to life!

Before switching the machine back on, make sure that there are no persons in the danger zone!

<br>
<br>

## 1.8 Instruction and Training

As the owner/operator, you are obliged to inform and instruct the operating personnel about existing legal and accident prevention regulations and about existing safety equipment on the extruder. This obligation also extends to safety equipment installed around the extruder. The various technical qualifications of the employees must be taken into account.

The operating personnel must have understood the instruction and it must be ensured that the instruction is observed.

This is the only way to ensure that your staff work in a safety and hazard-conscious manner. Compliance with the training content should be checked regularly.

As the owner/operator, you must therefore obtain written confirmation from each employee that they have attended a training session.

## 1.9 Noise emissions from the machine during activities

The noise emissions of the machine were measured on the same machine types. The measured values are listed in the appendix to these operating instructions. Under normal operating conditions, the maximum noise emission of the extruder is below the maximum permitted values.

Depending on the activity or the duration of the activity, the operator must determine whether suitable hearing protection is required as part of a risk assessment.

# 2 Life phases of the machine

<br>

## 2.1 Transport and installation

<br>

**Requirements for the installation site**

- Installation only in industrial and commercial indoor areas.
- Sufficient ventilation of the installation site must be ensured.
- It is recommended to install an extraction system at the nozzle.
- The location must be as fire-free as possible and equipped with a fire extinguisher.
- The foundation must be level and secure.

| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![Warning](images/manuals/extruder/w001.jpeg) | **Danger to life due to incorrect installation and commissioning!** <brErrors during installation can lead to life-threatening situations or cause considerable damage to property. Installation and commissioning may only be carried out by the manufacturer's employees. |

<br>
<br>

## 2.2 Assembly, installation and Commissioning

<br>

**Basic installation**

The extruder is supplied with a roller container, the parking brakes must be applied. The cables must be routed in such a way that they cannot be tripped over.

**Calibration of the temperature sensors and the pressure sensor**

The sensors are pre-calibrated ex works. Manual recalibration is only possible for the pressure sensor. Please refer to the KMK manufacturer's instructions for this.

<br>

**Connection to the power supply**

The CEE plug of the extruder must be plugged into a suitable three-phase socket with a right-hand field. If only a left-hand rotating field is available, the direction of rotation of the motor can alternatively be adjusted in the "Setup" tab of the software. The correct direction of rotation is marked with an arrow on the extruder.

<br>

**Updating the QiTech Control Software**

The machines are delivered with the newest version of the software installed. Updates, as well as previous updates and the software version can be viewed under Setup-> Updates. If a new version of the software is available, it will be displayed here. To perform the update an internet connection is required. In the next step, click the red "Select" button next to the chosen update. The display will now shut down, and when it is turned back on, the latest version of the software will be installed.

![screenshot updates](images/manuals/extruder/screenshot_updates.png)

<br>

**Safety Measures**

A number of important safety measures must be observed to ensure safe operation of the extruder:

- It is important to use only original fuses with the specified current ratings to prevent overloading.
- If inspection, maintenance and repair work is carried out on electrical components, these must be de-energized beforehand. Equipment that has been disconnected must be secured against unintentional or automatic reconnection. First check that there is no voltage and insulate neighbouring live components.
- Care must be taken to ensure that design features are not modified in such a way as to reduce safety.
- If it is necessary to work on live components, an additional person should be called in to operate the emergency stop button or the main switch in an emergency.
- Only voltage-insulated tools and appropriate clothing may be used.
- Proper earthing of the electrical system must be ensured by protective conductor systems.
- Cables must be checked regularly for damage and replaced if necessary.
- When working on high-voltage assemblies, the supply cable must be connected to earth after disconnecting the voltage and the components, e.g. capacitors, must be short-circuited with an earthing rod.

These safety measures are necessary to ensure safe and successful operation of the extruder.

<br>
<br>

## 2.3 Operation and control (work sequence)

<br>

A visual inspection must be carried out every working day before commissioning the machine. In particular, check that the die and melting head are fully screwed in.

| ![Warning](images/manuals/extruder/w001.jpeg) | **Danger to life due to operation of the machine in a faulty condition.** <br> If safety-relevant changes or defects occur on the machine, shut it down immediately, secure it against being switched on again and report the incident to the responsible office/person! |

<br>
<br>

## 2.4 Maintenance, inspection, Testing

Maintenance and repair work on the machine may only be carried out by reliable, trained personnel. The minimum age required by law in the country of use must be observed! Personnel to be trained, instructed or undergoing general training may only work on the extruder under the constant supervision of an experienced person! Heat-resistant gloves must be worn when working with hot components!

<br>

**Update extruder software**

There are regular updates for the "QiTech Control" software, which, in addition to troubleshooting, also include new features, functions or security updates. It is therefore recommended to check for new updates regularly for new versions of the control software. Updates for the machine software itself and installation instructions may also be provided there.

<br>

**Replacing the nozzle**
The nozzle can be replaced in the event of excessive wear, the need for a changed throughput or for greater resistance with composites. To do this, the system must be preheated to operating temperature. The nozzle can then be removed using a 19 mm spanner in an anticlockwise direction and a new nozzle inserted. It must be ensured that the system is depressurized for this.

<br>

**Replacing the melting head**

First empty the screw and remove the pressure sensor as described. With the system preheated, use a suitable hook spanner to loosen the melting head clockwise (left-hand thread!). Quickly screw in the new melting head anticlockwise before the thread becomes clogged with molten material. After screwing in, wait 15 minutes until the plastic in the melting head has liquefied before continuing extrusion.

<br>

**Dismantling the pressure sensor**

To avoid damaging the sensor, it must not be removed when the melt has cooled down. It is therefore advisable to always remove the sensor from a machine that is still warm (at production temperature). The screw must first be emptied and the sensor cable disconnected using the quick connector. When installing and removing the sensor, ensure that the diaphragm is not damaged by bumping or knocking.

If further work is necessary, such as replacing the extruder screw, please contact the manufacturer.

<br>
<br>

## 2.5 Troubleshooting and fault rectification

<br>

**Machine is not recognised by QiTech**

- Is the LAN-cable connected?
- Is the latest version of QiTech Control installed?

<br>

**Temperature sensors issue warnings**

- Check connections of temperature measuring unit and control unit for loose contact or cable breakage
- Check the routing of the motor cable and sensor cables. These should be as far apart as possible and should never be routed in parallel.

<br>

**Melt does not have the desired consistency or colour**

- Too liquid: Are the temperatures set too high? Has the plastic chemically decomposed or burnt?
- Too viscous: Are the temperatures set too low? Was the preheating sufficient?
- Has the screw been completely "flushed" with the new material so that there is no mixture?
- Has the granulate been completely dried before use?
- Is the starting material contaminated?

<br>

**Material throughput is not constant**

- Is the material in the hopper tilted or melted together?
- Is the size of the granulate grains small enough to be drawn in by the screw?
- Is the melting head or nozzle blocked?
- Was an attempt made to reduce the extrusion speed?
- Was there always enough material in the hopper?

<br>

**Are deposits forming on the melting head?**

- Is the temperature at the melting head high enough?
- Has an attempt been made to increase the temperature of the front heating zone?
- Has an attempt been made to additionally insulate the melting head (e.g. with glass wool)?

<br>

**The heating zones do not heat up at the same rate**

- Due to different thermal masses, it is to be expected that the heating zone in the centre heats up the

The fastest, the one at the melting head the second fastest and the one at the hopper the slowest.

Heating up usually takes about 30-45 minutes.

Is there another problem, or could the current problem not be solved with the guiding questions? Answers to problems with the filament can be found here: https://support.3devo.com/find-a-quick-answer#filament-quality-problems (as of 15/03/2023). For problems with the machine itself, contact the manufacturer directly.

<br>
<br>

## 2.6 Dismantling, decommissioning and disposal

When the machine has reached the end of its intended service life, it is recommended that the manufacturer be contacted for the purpose of taking it back free of charge. If this is not possible, the machine must be taken out of service permanently and then disposed of or scrapped properly.

To do this, the entire energy supply must first be separated. All components must then be separated according to material class to enable subsequent recycling or differentiated scrapping.

The machine consists largely of aluminium and steel and can be easily separated by loosening the screw connections. Electrical scrap, plastic, rubber seals, lubricants and other auxiliary materials must be disposed of separately by an authorised specialist company.

Appliances with this logo on the packaging or on the appliance must be disposed of separately. These devices must not be disposed of with normal household waste. You are responsible for ensuring that any electrical or electronic waste is disposed of at the appropriate locations, e.g. recycling centres.
