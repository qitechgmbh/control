/// Makes the current thread a real-time thread using the PREEMPT_RT capabilities of Linux.
///
/// This function configures the current thread with real-time scheduling properties by:
///
/// 1. Setting the scheduling policy to SCHED_FIFO (First-In-First-Out), which is a real-time
///    scheduling policy that allows the thread to run until it voluntarily yields, blocks on I/O,
///    or is preempted by a higher-priority real-time thread.
///
/// 2. Setting the real-time priority to 80 (on a scale of 1-99, where higher values indicate
///    higher priority). This priority level is chosen to be higher than most IRQ handlers
///    (typically priority 50) but lower than critical kernel tasks (priority 99).
///
/// When running on a PREEMPT_RT patched Linux kernel, this combination provides deterministic
/// scheduling with minimal latency, which is essential for real-time applications.
///
/// # Requirements
///
/// - The program must run with appropriate permissions to set real-time priorities.
///   This typically means either:
///   - Running as root
///   - Configuring `/etc/security/limits.conf` to allow the user to set real-time priorities
///
/// - The system should be running a Linux kernel with PREEMPT_RT patch applied for
///   optimal real-time performance.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```ignore
/// fn main() {
///     // Lock memory to prevent page faults
///     lock_memory();
///     
///     // Create a thread and make it real-time
///     std::thread::spawn(|| {
///         set_realtime_priority();
///         
///         // Real-time code here
///     });
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Returns
///
/// - `Ok(())` if the real-time priority was successfully set
/// - `Err` with the error message if setting the priority failed

/// # When to call this function
///
/// This function should be called from the main thread, as early as possible in your program's
/// execution, ideally before creating any threads and before allocating large amounts of memory.
///
/// Important: You only need to call this function ONCE per process, not in each thread.
/// The memory locking applies to the entire process, including:
/// - The main thread
/// - All threads created after the call
///
/// This happens because all threads in a process share the same virtual memory space, and
/// `mlockall()` operates on the entire process's memory space, not just the calling thread.
///
/// # Example: Correct usage
///
/// ```ignore
/// fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
///     // Call early in main, before creating threads
///     lock_memory()?;
///     
///     // Now create real-time threads...
///     std::thread::spawn(|| {
///         set_realtime_priority();
///         // Real-time code here
///     });
///     
///     Ok(())
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Example: Incorrect usage
///
/// ```ignore
/// fn main() {
///     // Don't do this - calling in each thread is unnecessary
///     std::thread::spawn(|| {
///         lock_memory().unwrap(); // Redundant if already called in main
///         set_realtime_priority();
///     });
