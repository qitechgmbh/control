## 1.4 Intended use.............................................................................................................................................

The JARVIS Pro Winder is designed for winding and rewinding filaments between 1 mm and 3 mm.

The winder must be placed on a stable, level surface or a braked trolley and secured if necessary. The test and
work sequence is described in chapter 3.4 Work sequence.

When using the winder, it is essential that the work steps described in the chapter "Work sequence" or in the
operating instructions are followed.

In the event of significant changes or deviations, it is necessary to carry out a new risk assessment in
accordance with the Machinery Directive and to document the changes in the corresponding documents.

The machine is designed exclusively for use inside buildings. The machine must not be
operated in potentially explosive atmospheres.
Use in the area of food production is prohibited.

Use of the machine for purposes other than those specified is prohibited.

Other intended uses include cleaning and maintenance work as well as troubleshooting, fault rectification and
repair.

## 1.5 Reasonably foreseeable misuse................................................................................................................

**Reasonably foreseeable misuse** exists in particular when winding unsuitable filaments:

- Filaments that are difficult to bend
- Easily tearable filaments
- Filaments outside the permitted diameter range of 1mm - 3mm
- Filaments with a surface temperature of> 50°C
- Particularly flat, sharp-edged or pointed filaments

In addition, the following procedures must be regarded as misuse:

- Operating the winder on an uneven surface or in a position other than the intended horizontal position
or on an unbraked trolley.
- The use of unauthorised coil sizes.
- Use of spare parts and components not authorised by the manufacturer.


- Operating the winder without supervision or in ghost shifts.

Figure 1: Authorised coil sizes

Furthermore, there is always the possibility that existing/provided safety guards are dismantled or the
existing sensors are manipulated or triggered by means other than the intended components.

The **misuse** mentioned must be explicitly prohibited with reference to these operating instructions and by written
operating instructions, and the use of the winder must also be explicitly restricted in the operating instructions to
the intended use mentioned above.

Maintenance and repair of the machine may only be carried out by the manufacturer's employees, trained
skilled workers or semi-skilled and trained personnel.

## 1.6 Significant change / other use

Any use of the machine other than the intended use is prohibited and is considered improper use. Claims of
any kind against the manufacturer or its authorised representatives due to damage resulting from improper
use of the machine are excluded. The operator alone is liable for all damage caused by improper use.

## 1.7 Description of the safety devices

**Emergency stop devices or emergency stop devices**


```
Figure 2: Emergency stop or emergency stop command device
```
The emergency stop switch is used to quickly stop the machine in the event of danger. It can be reached from
all positions in front of the machine. When an emergency stop device is actuated, the entire machine is
stopped by disconnecting the mains supply.

Hazardous movements are brought to a controlled standstill as quickly as possible. The machine can only be
restarted by physically resetting the emergency stop switch and then starting one of the operating modes in
the software.

**Overheating protection**
If one of the motor drivers becomes too hot, it switches off automatically and sends an error message to the
control system. This then stops all other components of the machine.

**Spool stop in the event of filament breakage**
If the filament tears during winding, the spool stops automatically after a short time.

**Separating protective devices:**

The housing clad with aluminium Dibond plates prevents contact with hot motors, interference with the drive
spindle of the traverse and manipulation of the electronics. It also prevents electrostatic charges from jumping
from the filament to the electronics.

If guards are opened or removed for maintenance work, they must be closed or refitted before the machine is
switched on again. It is not permitted to operate the machine without all properly installed and operational
protective devices.

## 1.8 Instruction and training............................................................................................................................

As the contractor/operator, you are obliged to inform and instruct the operating personnel about existing legal
and accident prevention regulations as well as about existing safety equipment on the winder. This obligation
also extends to safety equipment installed around the winder. The various technical qualifications of the
employees must be taken into account.


The operating personnel must have understood the instruction and it must be ensured that the instruction is
observed.

This is the only way to ensure that your personnel work in a safety and hazard-conscious manner. Compliance with
the contents of the instruction should be checked regularly.

As the owner/operator, you must therefore obtain written confirmation from each employee that they have
attended an instruction session.

## 1.9 Noise emissions from the machine during activities

The noise emissions of the machine were measured on the same machine types. Under normal operating
conditions, the maximum noise emission of the extruder is below the maximum permitted values.

Depending on the activity or the duration of the activity, the operator must determine whether suitable hearing
protection is required as part of a risk assessment.


## 2 Life phases of the machine

## 2.1 Transport and assembly

**Requirements for the installation site**

- Installation only in industrial and commercial indoor areas.
- The surface must be level and solid.
- The location must be as fire-free as possible and equipped with a fire extinguisher.

## 2.2 Assembly, installation and commissioning

**Basic installation**

If the winder is supplied without a base, it must be screwed to the surface with M8 screws at each of the four
corners.

If the Winder is supplied with a mobile container, the parking brakes must be applied.

In both cases, the cables must be routed in such a way that they cannot be tripped over.

**Installing the JARVIS Control Software**

The machine is controlled using the specially designed JARVIS Control software. This can either be obtained
from the manufacturer's website or installed on a Windows or MacOS system from the enclosed USB stick.
Follow the instructions in the software to install the required drivers and establish a connection with the
winder via the USB cable.

```
Caution!
Danger to life due to incorrect installation and commissioning!
Errors during installation can lead to life-threatening situations or cause considerable damage to
property.
Installation and commissioning may only be carried out by the manufacturer's employees.
```
```
Danger!
Risk of injury due to improper transport.
Be careful when loading the machine, do not place any limbs under the parts when setting them
down, do not stand under suspended loads or between moving loads and walls or machine parts.
Wear personal protective equipment: safety shoes, protective work clothing, protective gloves
```

Some important safety measures must be observed to ensure safe operation of the extruder:

- It is important to only use original fuses with the prescribed current ratings to avoid overloading.
- If inspection, maintenance and repair work is carried out on electrical components, these must be de-
    energised beforehand. Equipment that has been disconnected must be secured against unintentional
    or automatic reconnection. First check that there is no voltage and insulate neighbouring live
    components.
- Care must be taken to ensure that design features are not modified in such a way as to reduce safety.
- If it is necessary to work on live components, an additional person should be called in to operate
    the emergency stop button or the main switch in an emergency.
- Only voltage-insulated tools and appropriate clothing may be used.
- Proper earthing of the electrical system must be ensured by protective conductor systems.
- Cables must be checked regularly for damage and replaced if necessary.

## 2.3 Operation and control (work sequence)

A visual inspection must be carried out every working day before the machine is started

up. Then start the machine as follows:

1. Switch on the machine by plugging in the mains plug
    - Connect the machine to the control software
    - Connect the USB cable to the PC
    - Follow the instructions in JARVIS Control
    - Winder then appears in the "Machines" tab of the software
2. Mount the bobbin on the bobbin axle
    - Remove the quick-release fastener
    - Move the driver in the groove to the height of the hole in the coil flank
    - Slide the bobbin over the axle and the driver
    - Tighten the quick-release fastener again
3. Calibrating the bobbin sides
    - Select "Calibrate" in the function bar of the software
    - Move the "Endstops" slider to the approximate position of the inside of the bobbin
    - Click on "Calibrate" again
    - using the laser dot, repeat the previous steps and fine-tune until the dot is exactly on the edge
       of the inner bobbin flank
    - Repeat the same process for the other outer coil flank
4. Adjust the filament diameter


- Adjust the diameter of the filament in the Settings tab (1.75 mm by default)
- Select "Pull in" in the function bar
- Thread the filament through the puller rollers (be careful, counter-rotating rollers!)
- For extrusion: Use the "Puller Speed" slider to manually adjust the speed until the filament has
    the desired diameter
5. Start winding
- Depending on the winding speed and the desired winding pressure, load the load arm with the
appropriate number of weighted discs (slow winding with few discs, fast winding with more
discs)
- Rotate the load arm upwards and place it on the puller
- Press the "Wind" button
- Thread the filament coming out of the puller through the feeder into the spool and fix it there
- Place the load arm on the filament strand from above
6. Change the spool
- Press the "Pull in" button
- Remove the spool as described above and insert a new spool
- Continue winding by clicking on "Wind"
7. Stopping the winding process
- "Standby" mode - motors energised but not in motion or
- Select "Off" mode - no current on the motors
- If the filament gets caught, the spool spins or there is a danger to persons, press the emergency
stop button
8. Switch off the machine by disconnecting the mains connection and the USB cable

**Unwinding filament**

- Mount the filament roll to be unwound onto the spool axle
- Select the "Pull out" function
- Feed the filament through the puller rollers in the opposite direction to winding (caution,
    counter-rotating rollers!)
- Omit the traverseer and fold the load arm upwards

**Changing process variables during operation**
All settings such as the position of the spool sides, the winding speed or the filament diameter can also be
adjusted during the winding process without interrupting it. To do this, change the value in the relevant field
and click the "Wind" button again to apply it. As soon as a setting has been changed, it is marked with an
orange bar.

**Rewinding filament - not all winder versions**

- Mount the full spool on the holder provided for this purpose


- Mount the empty bobbin on the bobbin axle
- Calibrate the winding sides and set the filament width
- Slightly increase the pressure on the axle with the full spool using the rotary wheel on the top of the
    housing
- Guide the filament from the full spool over the feeder and fix it to the spool
- Click on "Rewind" in the Jarvis Control function bar
- Adjust the rewinding speed using the slider

**Automatically tune the winding speed to the desired diameter**

- Ensure that both a DRE and the winder are connected to Jarvis Control
- Ensure that the extruder has a constant output of +-1% fluctuation
- Enter the distance between the DRE measuring window and extruder nozzle in the "Settings" tab
- Start the winding process as usual via "Wind"
- Activate the "Sync to DRE" button next to the "Puller Speed" slider
- Wait approx. 10 minutes until the filament diameter is within the range of the set value

**Stop the winding process automatically after a certain number of metres**

- Activate the "Auto stop winding or pulling" option
- Select target length, target mode and alarm settings
- Click on "Wind" or "Pull" in the function bar
- As soon as the blue progress bar has reached the right-hand edge of the screen, the desired
    number of metres has been wound and the winder automatically switches to the specified mode

## 2.4 Maintenance, inspection, testing

Maintenance and servicing work on the machine may only be carried out by
only be carried out by reliable, trained personnel. The minimum age required by law in the country of use must be
observed!
Personnel to be trained, instructed or undergoing general training may only work on the Winder under the
constant supervision of an experienced person!

**Updating the Winder software**
There are regular updates for the "JARVIS Control" software, which may contain bug fixes as well as new
functions or security updates. It is therefore recommended that you regularly check the manufacturer's
website for new versions of the control software. Updates for the machine software itself and installation
instructions may also be provided there.

```
Danger!
Danger to life due to operation of the machine in faulty condition
If safety-relevant changes or defects occur on the
If safety-relevant changes or defects occur on the machine, shut down immediately, secure against
restarting and report the process to the responsible office/person!
```

**Lubricating the traverse spindle**
The threaded spindle must be re-oiled after approx. 20 operating hours, but at the latest when the traverser no
longer moves to the desired position because the motor is spinning.
To do this, loosen the plate on the top of the housing with an M5 Allen key and drizzle commercially available
lubricating oil or grease, e.g. WD40, over the entire length of the threaded spindle.

**Retightening screw connections**
After approx. 100 operating hours, the rear panel of the winder should be removed using an M5 Allen key so that
the screw connections inside the housing can be retightened. The following should be checked:

- Grub screws of the motor couplings (puller, traverse, coil)
- Fastening screws of the motors (puller, traverse, coil)
- Fastening screws of the angle sensor of the load arm All

should be tightened at least hand-tight.

**Replacing the puller rollers**
The polyurethane coating of the puller rollers will inevitably wear out over time. As soon as you notice the
filament slipping through the rollers, they should be replaced. Suitable spare parts are available from the dealer.
To replace them, the rear panel must be removed and the screws of the puller panelling loosened from the
rear. The connection between the motor axle and rollers must also be disconnected. By loosening a few screws
on the front panelling on the side of the puller, it is possible to remove the panelling by bending it slightly. The
rollers can now be pulled off the axles and replaced.

## 2.5 Troubleshooting and fault rectification....................................................................................................

**Machine is not recognised by JARVIS Control**

- Is the USB cable connected?
- Are the drivers listed in the software installed correctly?
- Is the latest version of JARVIS Control installed?
- Is the device displayed in the "Device Manager" (Windows)?
**Filament tears off frequently**
- Was the filament sufficiently cooled before winding?
- Have the weights been removed from the load arm?
- Is the filament within the permitted diameter range of 1mm - 3mm?

**Puller rollers are scored**
It is normal for the puller rollers to wear out over time. However, some options can be checked

**Caution!**

```
Observe the instructions for maintenance work when servicing the machine!
```

can be checked:

- Is the surface temperature< 50°C when the filament runs through the rollers?
- Is the filament slipping through the rollers instead of being conveyed by them, causing more
    abrasion?
- Is the tension of the filament too strong? Adjust with weights if necessary.

**Filament is not wound perfectly parallel**

- How large is the inner diameter of the spool on which the filament is wound? The closer the winding is
    to the traverse, the better the winding pattern will be.
- Have the spool sides been calibrated as described?
- Has the correct filament diameter been set?
- Have you tried to fine-tune the two settings independently of the procedure described here?
- Does the problem already occur in the first layer, or only afterwards? If the first layer is not perfectly
    wound (e.g. due to skewed threading), the filament in the subsequent layers always slips into the
    gaps in the winding below and "perfect winding" can no longer take place.

**Winder suddenly switches off**
One of the motor drivers has probably overheated. To prevent uncontrolled winding behaviour, the controller
therefore switches off the entire winder. It is advisable to wait approx. 5 minutes and try winding again. If the
error occurs frequently, a lower ambient temperature (optionally housing temperature) must be ensured.

**Load adjustment does not work correctly at high or low speeds**
The sensor inside the housing has probably twisted and the load adjustment range has therefore shifted
upwards or downwards. To rectify this, turn the angle sensor back and tighten its screws as described in
"Tightening screw connections".

## 2.6 Dismantling, decommissioning and disposal

When the machine has reached the end of its planned service life, it is recommended that the manufacturer be
contacted for the purpose of taking it back free of charge. If this is not possible, the machine must be taken out
of service permanently and then disposed of or scrapped properly.

To do this, first disconnect the entire power supply. All components must then be separated by material class to
enable subsequent recycling or differentiated scrapping.

The machine consists largely of aluminium and plastic and can be easily separated by loosening the screw
connections. Electrical scrap, plastic, rubber seals, lubricants and other auxiliary materials must be
disposed of separately by an authorised specialist company.


## 3 Hazard warning and information on residual risks
