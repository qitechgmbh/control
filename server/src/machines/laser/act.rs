/// Implements the `Actor` trait for the `LaserMachine`.
///
/// # Parameters
/// - `_now_ts`: The current timestamp of type `Instant`.
///
/// # Returns
/// A pinned `Future` that resolves to `()` and is `Send`-safe. The future encapsulates the asynchronous behavior of the `act` method.
///
/// # Description
/// This method is called to perform periodic actions for the `LaserMachine`. Specifically:
/// - It checks if the time elapsed since the last measurement emission exceeds 20 milliseconds.
/// - If the condition is met, it asynchronously emits Laser data by calling `emit_laser_data` and updates the `last_measurement_emit` timestamp.
///
/// The method ensures that the diameter value is updated approximately 60 times per second.
///
